# Spotify-Top-2000
## Statistical Data Mining Class Project using the Spotify Top 2000 data set.

This repository includes my class project report and code files for the Statistical Data Mining course at UNCW (STT 550, Fall 2022). The files included are from work performed in a team of three, we collaborated on the code and the presentation. The report paper was written solely by myself as each team member was required to submit their own written report (we were required to list all team members' names on the written reports).
